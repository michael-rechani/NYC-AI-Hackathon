# AI Hackathon for NYC Public Sector

A fast-paced, hands-on event where teams go from idea to working Azure application in a single day — built with GitHub Copilot, working side-by-side with Microsoft engineers.

Participants design, build, and deploy a real Azure application using secure, enterprise-ready services and leave with a tangible solution and a clear path to production.
