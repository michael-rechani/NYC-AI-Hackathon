# Prompt Scenario 3 — AI-Powered Application with Azure OpenAI

> Use GitHub Copilot prompts to build a web application with an integrated AI feature powered by Azure OpenAI.

---

## The Scenario

You are a developer adding intelligent capabilities to an existing web application. The business wants to enhance the user experience with an AI-powered feature — such as a chatbot, a document Q&A tool, or a smart search assistant. The PaaS infrastructure and Azure AI Foundry resources are already provisioned.

The application will run on **Azure App Service** and use **Azure OpenAI** (via Azure AI Foundry) to power the AI feature.

## Your Mission

Use the GitHub Copilot prompts below to build and deploy your solution.

> **Prompts will be provided at the start of the event. The structure below shows what you'll be building toward.**

### What you'll build

- A web application deployed on **Azure App Service**
- An AI-powered feature using **Azure OpenAI** — choose one:
  - A **chatbot** that answers questions in natural language
  - A **document Q&A** tool (upload a file, ask questions about it)
  - A **smart assistant** integrated into an existing CRUD app
- Backend logic to call the Azure OpenAI API and return results to the user

### Suggested tech stack

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS or a lightweight framework of your choice
- **Backend**: Python, Node.js, or .NET
- **AI**: Azure OpenAI Service (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo)
- **Hosting**: Azure App Service

## Evaluation

Your submission will be assessed on:

- Is the app running on Azure App Service?
- Does the AI feature work and return meaningful responses?
- Is the Azure OpenAI integration clean and functional?
- Bonus: conversation history, streaming responses, grounding with real data
